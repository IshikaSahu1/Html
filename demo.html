                A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and
                Connors 116). Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph. For
                instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one
                sentence long.
